### 💾 Data Management

#### Local Storage Implementation
The platform uses browser Local Storage for data persistence, enabling:
- **Offline Functionality**: Core features work without internet connectivity
- **User Preferences**: Theme settings, assessment results, and user profiles persist across sessions
- **Mock Data Management**: Development and demonstration data stored locally
- **Assessment History**: Previous quiz results and progress tracking

#### Data Models
```typescript
// User Authentication
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  userType: 'student' | 'counselor';
}

// Mental Health Assessment
interface AssessmentResult {
  userId: string;
  responses: number[];
  score: number;
  severity: 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high' | 'critical';
  recommendations: string[];
  timestamp: string;
}

// Blog Posts & Comments
interface BlogPost {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  author: string;
  authorId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  excerpt: string;
  comments: Comment[];
}
```

## Server Architecture & Deployment

### 🌐 Hosting & Infrastructure

The platform is designed as a **static web application** that can be deployed on various hosting platforms:

#### Recommended Hosting Options:
1. **Vercel** (Primary Choice)
   - Automatic deployments from Git repositories
   - Global CDN for fast content delivery
   - Built-in analytics and performance monitoring
   - Custom domain support

2. **Netlify**
   - Git-based continuous deployment
   - Form handling and serverless functions
   - Branch previews for testing

3. **GitHub Pages**
   - Free hosting for public repositories
   - Automatic deployment from GitHub Actions
   - Custom domain support

### 🔧 Build Process

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev          # Starts Vite development server on localhost:5173

# Production build
npm run build        # Creates optimized production bundle in dist/
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally

# Code quality
npm run lint         # ESLint code analysis
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
```

### 📦 Production Deployment

1. **Build Optimization**:
   - Code splitting for efficient loading
   - Asset optimization and compression
   - Dead code elimination
   - Modern JavaScript bundling

2. **Performance Features**:
   - Lazy loading for improved initial load times
   - Image optimization and responsive loading
   - CSS purging for minimal bundle size
   - Browser caching strategies

### 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Client-Side Authentication**: Suitable for educational/demonstration purposes
